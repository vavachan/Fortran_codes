This a molecular dynamics simulation. I had written this code as a part of my summer project under Dr Anil Kumar, NISER. 
This code is written is FORTRAN. This is a very basic 3D molecular dynamics simulation. It uses LJ potential, and uses velocity-verlet algorithm.

Upon running this will produce 2files , energy.dat, MSD.dat.

MSD is mean square displacement wrt time.
energy.dat is kinetic energy , potential energy and total energy wrt time. last column is temperature.
